###Iterative Wallpaper

The output for this project has been driven by experimenting with code. I started with a simple iterative pattern created by rotating ellipses in the center of the screen and every aspect of the output has grown from that.

The aesthetic issue I was most interested in addressing was the use of colour. I wanted to create colours that looked like glowing neon lights.  This has been achieved by using using bright colours with varying levels of transparency and a black background.  A side affect of this is that I have also created some very interesting textures within the patterns. 

The overall design of the wallpaper is heavily affected by randomness. This result of this is that the output can be very satisfying buy can also become overly busy and look messy. I stumbled upon a very interesting result accidentally by leaving the browser open for a long time.  The resulting pattern looked like a sponge painting and consisted of many interesting textures.
