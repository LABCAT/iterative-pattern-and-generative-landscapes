###Iterative Wallpaper 2
I decided to make quite a big change to the appearance of my wallpaper pattern. The reason I decided to do this is because I was thinking about how the pattern would look when expanded onto a bigger canvas.  

My previous pattern would have had a similar appearance regardless of the canvas size. For this pattern I have thought very carefully about how the pattern would work when viewed at different scales.

At the core of the pattern there is hexagon shaped pattern made from three groups of glyphs.  Each group has a different colour and the outer group is connected to each other by glowing lines through the center of the glyphs.  This hexagon pattern is then used to create a 3x3 grid with each using a different colour set. The 3x3 grid is then repeated both horizontally and vertically depending on the canvas size.

I think this pattern works very well on a large scale. It has a simple but interesting pattern to view from a distance and when viewed from close up there are lots intricate details to maintain interest.
